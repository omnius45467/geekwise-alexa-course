## Last Day of Class

Today we will be continuing developing our skills.

### During this time...

I want everyone to think back to when the class started, where were you as a programmer? Besides gaining familiarity 
with the new platform, has this course helped your understanding of programming in general in anyway?

### Some things to think about...

What do you feel you have gained? What could have gone better? 

If Geekwise offered this class again, what would make it better?

### Last Thoughts

Unfortunately today is the last day of class. It is my hope that everyone continues developing Alexa Skills. 
Feel free to contact me if anyone has questions in the future.
