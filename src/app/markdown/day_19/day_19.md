## Further Development

Today we will be continuing our skill development. During this time I will also be working on a few skills, if you want 
to ask me questions about my work flow, or if you want to know my plans for Alexa skills just ask!

### Objectives
* Further develop some of your Alexa Skills
* Ask questions

### Key Things to Think About

* Do you feel like you can make a business out of developing Alexa Skills?
* How can you make Alexa smarter?
* After the class, how do you think you can debug your own issues?
* What are the limitations of the platform, and how can you overcome them?
* How can your skills scale for larger audiences
