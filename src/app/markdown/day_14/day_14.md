## Experimentation

Today we will be focusing on using what I exposed you to in the previous lesson to construct something more original.
I gave you a list of tools that you can use to give Alexa some super powers these tools being...

* [ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok)
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
* [mlab](https://mlab.com/)

I also provided you with some boilerplate to get your mind thinking in terms of IoT and server side code with javascript.

* [database-connection skill](https://github.com/sammyboy45467/Bitwise-Skill)
* [simple express server with no database connection](https://github.com/sammyboy45467/Simple-Express)
* [cylonjs with express](https://github.com/sammyboy45467/cylon-express-server)

### Objectives

* Get your hands dirty with Alexa, servers, databases, and IoT
* Experiment with hacking technology together
* Brainstorm how you want to change your world

### Getting Dirty

Today your task will be to plan the concept for a skill, or a series of skills. We have just a few days left in the 
course and I would really like for everyone to experience the power of javascript, the Alexa platform, and their own imagination. 

You will be broken up into teams. In these teams you will have a series of options

#### Option 1

Unlike the last team assignments you will not have be working together on just one skill, you will each be working 
on your own skills and have your team members to help. This would be ideal if there is something very specific that 
you want to accomplish. This option is great for individuals that do not want to work with IoT.

#### Option 2

If you want to work with everything that we have explored thus far in the class this is the option for you. 
You will work in small teams either on your own projects or as a group. If this is your first experience working 
with servers I would suggest working together. A few minds are better than just one.
