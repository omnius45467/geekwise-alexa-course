## Day Of Development

Today you will be able to build out the Alexa Skills you've been dreaming of.

### Objectives
* Review the progress from yesterday, did anyone find a solution?
* Brainstorm new skills
* Build those skills
* Listen to some lame jokes
* Have fun

### What are your thoughts about the exercise yesterday?

Did anyone find the solution to the problem?

### What kind of skills do you want to publish?

Here are some key points to think about

* Users like to use things that are simple easy to use and almost always fairly straight forward to use
* You don't have to make the next Pokemon Go, just make something useful and/or fun
* As you practice your javascript and your Alexa Skills will get better

### Think outside the browser

In the past couple weeks I've shown you how to take browser tech, and hardware tech and merge them together. 
You'd be surprised the interesting things that can be done when you do this.
