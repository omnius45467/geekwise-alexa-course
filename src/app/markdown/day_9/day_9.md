## Group Assignments

Today we will be breaking up into groups. The plan is to figure out what it means to work in a team while 
doing development work. We will have 3 teams that will be working together on the same Alexa Skill. 

For these assignments you might have to revisit some of the days work that we have already covered. 
Don't be afraid to ask your team mates for help. Make sure you start with your concept first. 
It is a good idea to build an 'intent map' that way planning interacts will be easily implemented. 

If you happen to finish these skills before class is over, don't worry there are plenty more we have in mind!

### Team 1 Assignment

Team 1 will work together to plan out a skill that can be used for a shopping/grocery list. 
Keep in mind that your skill needs to use the most minimal amount of Slots and Intents. If you can manage to make a 
randomized response and still deliver the results that you user might be looking for you will have completed the assignment.

#### Your Tool Set
* Use the [AlexaBoilerplate](https://github.com/sammyboy45467/AlexaBoilerplate)
* Push your code to github, create a repository and have everyone be a contributor 
* Try and test the skill on your Tap by the end of class
* Share the links with us

### Team 2 Assignment

Team 2 will use a specific npm package to generate jokes, this package is called [Joke-Me](https://github.com/himynameisdave/joke-me). 
This package is usually used on the command line but today we will hack it to be used with Alexa. Try and give your skill some randomized responses. 
Use callbacks and setTimeouts to make the skill sound fluid and natural.

#### Your Tool Set
* Use the [AlexaBoilerplate](https://github.com/sammyboy45467/AlexaBoilerplate)
* Use the [Joke-Me](https://github.com/himynameisdave/joke-me) node package
* Push your code to github, create a repository and have everyone be a contributor
* Try and test the skill on your Tap by the end of class
* Share the links with us

### Team 3 Assignment

Team 3 will use a few npm packages to produce a skill that can handle posting tweets to twitter. 
Your skill should only allow a 140 characters, when it is over 140 characters Alexa should warn the user that it will not be possible to post.
Limit the number of intents that you will be using and let your utterances be flexible enough to handle more then one interaction. 
If there is enough time allow the user to hear their last tweet.

#### Your Tool Set
* Use the [AlexaBoilerplate](https://github.com/sammyboy45467/AlexaBoilerplate)
* Use the [Twitter API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter) node package, there are a number of options
* Push your code to github, create a repository and have everyone be a contributor
* Try and test the skill on your Tap by the end of class
* Share the links with us
