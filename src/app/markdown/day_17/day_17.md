* Debug Issues
* Get your Questions Answered
* Exercise Those Creative Ideas

Today's Adventure will be slightly different then our previous encounters with Alexa and her skills.
Up until today the class has mainly been me showing how things can go together to get Alexa 
to have appropriate responses for a given intent, today you will be showing me how to code a custom Alexa Skill with server integration.

Now is the perfect time to get your questions answered.

Together we can possibly create something the internet hasn't seen before!
